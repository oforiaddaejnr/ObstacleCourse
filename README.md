# ObstacleCourse
A simple Unity game I made where the user has to navigate various obstacle courses
This is a FPS game
You can navigate the course using the W,A,S,D keys and the mouse to move the camera about
Inspired from the gravity gun Half-life, you can pull objects within a certain range towards you
by clicking on the left mouse button. If you want to let go of the object, let go of the left mouse
button. If you want to throw the object you are holding, press the right mouse button
